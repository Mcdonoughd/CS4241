three U's
  Usable (speed)
  Universal (ability/background support)
  Useful (good functionality/ solves problem)

Divide into TASKS
  Home = immediate info

emotional alignment
  color space
  button/font size
  typography

Flow interface
  skill v challenge chart
  Modular design -
    define operators
    human psychology

do not EVER do adaptive design

Design + Evaluation = best

Eval Measures;
  Time to learn to do a specific TASKS
  Speed of the tasks
  Error Rate
  Retention (Over time)
  Subjective Perceptions

Abilities and Accessibility (Do not collect anything you dont need to keep anon & secure)
